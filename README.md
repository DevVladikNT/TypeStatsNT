# TypeStatsNT

Yet another utility program for collecting data on keyboard usage.

## Description

This program counts how many times keys on your keyboard were pressed and saves the result in JSON files locally.
Don't worry, no data is sent to the FBI, it's just for your personal use xD.

After a few hours, you can see the statistics:

* Most used keys overall (including `Enter`, `Ctrl`, etc.).
* Letter sequences (for example, after pressing `i`, there's a 24.19% chance of pressing `n` for me).

> [!WARNING]
> Keep in mind that I'm not sure whether anti-cheat systems can detect this program,
so I think you should turn it off if you're worried. If you have any other information, please let me know.

## How to use

At first you must have Python installed. Install dependencies and run `main.py`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
